Building Z-Wave Device Handlers
===============================

Z-Wave is a proprietary protocol, so we cannot document the full details
of the interface. Instead, device handlers use command objects that
represent the standard commands and messages that Z-Wave devices use to
send and request information.

Parsing Events
--------------

When events from Z-Wave devices are passed into your device handler's parse method, they are in an encoded string format. The first
thing your parse method should do is call ``zwave.parse`` on the
description string to convert it to a Z-Wave command object. The
object's class is one of the subclasses of
``physicalgraph.zwave.Command`` that can be found in the `Z-Wave Command
Reference <https://graph.api.smartthings.com/ide/doc/zwave-utils.html>`__. If the description string
does not represent a valid Z-Wave command, ``zwave.parse`` will return
``null``.

.. code-block:: groovy

    def parse(String description) {
        def result = null
        def cmd = zwave.parse(description)
        if (cmd) {
            result = zwaveEvent(cmd)
            log.debug "Parsed ${cmd} to ${result.inspect()}"
        } else {
            log.debug "Non-parsed event: ${description}"
        }
        return result
    }

Once you have a command object, the recommended way of handling it is to
pass it to a overloaded function such as ``zwaveEvent`` used in this
example, with different argument types for the different types of
commands you intend to handle:

.. code-block:: groovy

    def zwaveEvent(physicalgraph.zwave.commands.basicv1.BasicReport cmd)
    {
        def result
        if (cmd.value == 0) {
            result = createEvent(name: "switch", value: "off")
        } else {
            result = createEvent(name: "switch", value: "on")
        }
        return result
    }

    def zwaveEvent(physicalgraph.zwave.commands.meterv3.MeterReport cmd) {
        def result
        if (cmd.scale == 0) {
            result = createEvent(name: "energy", value: cmd.scaledMeterValue, unit: "kWh")
        } else if (cmd.scale == 1) {
            result = createEvent(name: "energy", value: cmd.scaledMeterValue, unit: "kVAh")
        } else {
            result = createEvent(name: "power", value: cmd.scaledMeterValue, unit: "W")
        }
        return result
    }

    def zwaveEvent(physicalgraph.zwave.Command cmd) {
        // This will capture any commands not handled by other instances of zwaveEvent
        // and is recommended for development so you can see every command the device sends
        return createEvent(descriptionText: "${device.displayName}: ${cmd}")
    }

Remember that when you use ``createEvent`` to build an event, the
resulting map must be returned from ``parse`` for the event to be sent.
For information about ``createEvent``, see the `Creating Events <parse.html#creating-events>`__ section.

As the `Z-Wave Command Reference <https://graph.api.smartthings.com/ide/doc/zwave-utils.html>`__
shows, many Z-Wave command classes have multiple versions. By default,
``zwave.parse`` will parse a command using the highest version of the
command class. If the device is sending an earlier version of the
command, some fields may be missing, or the command may fail to parse
and return ``null``. To fix this, you can pass in a map as the second
argument to ``zwave.parse`` to tell it which version of each command
class to use:

.. code-block:: groovy

    zwave.parse(description, [0x26: 1, 0x70: 1])

This example will use version 1 of SwitchMultilevel (0x26) and
Configuration (0x70) instead of the highest versions.

Sending Commands
----------------

To send a Z-Wave command to the device, you must create the command
object, call ``format`` on it to convert it to the encoded string
representation, and return it from the command method.

.. code-block:: groovy

    def on() {
        return zwave.basicV1.basicSet(value: 0xFF).format()
    }

There is a shorthand provided to create command objects:
``zwave.basicV1.basicSet(value: 0xFF)`` is the same as
``new physicalgraph.zwave.commands.basicv1.BasicSet(value: 0xFF)``. Note
the different capitalization of the command name and the 'V' in the
command class name.

The value 0xFF passed in to the command is a hexadecimal number. Many
Z-Wave commands use 8-bit integers to represent device state. Generally
0 means "off" or "inactive", 1-99 are used as percentage values for a
variable level attribute, and 0xFF or 255 (the highest value) means "on"
or "detected".

If you want to send more than one Z-Wave command, you can return a list
of formatted command strings. It is often a good idea to add a delay
between commands to give the device an opportunity to finish processing
each command and possibly send a response before receiving the next
command. To add a delay between commands, include a string of the form
``"delay N"`` where N is the number of milliseconds to delay. There is a
helper method ``delayBetween`` that will take a list of commands and
insert delay commands between them:

.. code-block:: groovy

    def off() {
        delayBetween([
            zwave.basicV1.basicSet(value: 0).format(),
            zwave.switchBinaryV1.switchBinaryGet().format()
        ], 100)
    }

This example returns the output of ``delayBetween``, and thus will send
a BasicSet command, followed by a 100 ms delay (0.1 seconds), then a
SwitchBinaryGet command in order to check immediately that the state of
the switch was indeed changed by the *set* command.

Sending commands in response to events
--------------------------------------

In some situations, instead of sending a command in response to a
request by the user, you want to automatically send a command to the
device on receipt of a Z-Wave command.

If you return a list from the parse method, each item of the list will
be evaluated separately. Items that are maps will be processed as events
as usual and sent to subscribed SmartApps and mobile clients. Returned
items that are HubAction items, however, will be sent via the hub to the
device, in much the same way as formatted commands returned from command
methods. The easiest way to send a command to a device in response to an
event is the ``response`` helper, which takes a Z-Wave command or encoded
string and supplies a HubAction:

.. code-block:: groovy

    def zwaveEvent(physicalgraph.zwave.commands.wakeupv1.WakeUpNotification cmd)
    {
        sendEvent(descriptionText: "${device.displayName} woke up", displayed: false)
        def result = []
        result << zwave.batteryV1.batteryGet().format()
        result << "delay 1200"
        result << zwave.wakeUpV1.wakeUpNoMoreInformation().format()
        response(result) // returns the result of reponse()
    }

The above example uses the ``response`` helper to send Z-Wave commands
and delay commands to the device whenever a WakeUpNotification event is
received. The reception of this event that indicates that the sleepy
device is temporarily listening for commands. In addition to creating a
hidden event, the handler will send a BatteryGet request, wait 1.2
seconds for a response, and then issue a WakeUpNoMoreInformation command
to tell the device it can go back to sleep to save battery.
