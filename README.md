SmartThings Developer Documentation
===================================

This is the repository for the SmartThings developer documentation.

It is powered by ReadTheDocs and Sphinx.

###Contributing###
We love contributions! If you find a typo, error, or think something can be communicated better, fork this repo and make a pull request.

If you have a larger change that might involve a lot of new content or organization, let us know in advance. This documentation is a work in progress,
and we would hate it any time was wasted due to conflicts.

###Building the docs###
Run `make help` for the available targets (note that if you do not have sphinx installed locally, 
the generated HTML won't have the same theme as it does on docs.smartthings.com).
