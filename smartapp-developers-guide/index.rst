 - `How to Build a SmartApp Demo Video <https://youtu.be/WdmKTq6Gk_w>`__ (2 minutes)
 - `Getting Started Guide <../getting-started.html>`__ - a tutorial for creating your first SmartApp.

After that, you should review the :ref:`anatomy-and-lifecycle-of-a-smartapp` to understand the overall structure and lifecycle of a SmartApp.
