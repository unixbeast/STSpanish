Web Services SmartApps
======================

SmartApps may themselves be a web service, exposing a URL and any defined endpoints.

This allows external applications to make web API calls to a SmartApp, and get information about, or control, end devices.

To understand how Web Services SmartApps work, including the security measures in place, read the :ref:`web_services_smartapps_overview` guide.

For a step-by-step tutorial creating a Web Services SmartApp, read the SmartApp as Web Service tutorial. It's organized into two parts:

- :ref:`smartapp_as_web_service_part_1`, will walk you through a simple SmartApp that exposes endpoints, and use the simulator and curl to test making API calls to your SmartApp.
- :ref:`smartapp_as_web_service_part_2` will guide you through the steps an external application would take to integrate with SmartThings.
