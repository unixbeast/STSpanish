Service Manager Design Pattern
==============================

Basic Overview
--------------

Devices that connect through the internet as a whole (cloud) or LAN
devices (on your local network) require a defined Service-Manager
SmartApp, in addition to the usually expected Device Handler. The
service manager makes the connection with the device, handling the input
and output interactions, and the device handler parses messages, as
usual.

Cloud-Connected Devices
-----------------------

When using a cloud-connected device, the service manager is used to
discover and initiate a connection between the device and your hub,
using OAuth connections to external third parties. Then the
device-handler uses this connection to communicate between the hub and
device.

LAN-Connected Devices
---------------------

When using a LAN connected device, the service manager is used to
discover and initiate a connection between the device and your hub,
using the protocols SSDP or mDNS/DNS-SD. Then the device-handler uses
UPnP/SOAP Calls or REST Calls to communicate outgoing messages between
the hub and device.
